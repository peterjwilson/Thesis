Problems:
	- Composite only works when set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
	- quad gauss point results are crap for the existing element too!

To Do:	
	- Element tests
		- Lin and NL statics
		- Lin and NL statics
	- Do stability problems, compare results between different element technologies on and off, as well as NL and LPB
		- Euler buckling of CHS with unstructured mesh will show diff between ANDES and not - membrane locking
		- Wrinkle stuff
	- Eigenvalue stability solver
		- check with CSE off if the global K mat is symm!		
	

	Benchmarking:
	- nonlinear load increment - line 65
	
	Report:
		- Writeup for CHS buckling
		- Writeup for wrinkle problem
		- Kg derivation for shells ????
		
		- (Up next)
		- Transverse shear stress results discussion!
		- Stresses on the bottom surface of compsites should be positive under bending!?!?!?!
		- 
		- (Soon)
		- 3 param background - figure out why Gotta figure out lamda - G = lamda
		- 
		- (Whenever)
		- Cleanup equation spacing
		- alignment of pseudocode on page - try out figure around algortithm
		- Check Bibliography special characters
		- Check breaking of \texttt formatted words
		- See if kratos thick tri material mat includes off-diag poisson and update report!
