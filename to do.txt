Problems:
	- Composite only works when set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
	- quad gauss point results are crap for the existing element too!
		- No just my element, the thick quad also does this for the plate bending mesh
			- main improvement from beta1 = 0. Wait for Haugen response
			- shell quantity recovery benchmarks

To Do:		
	Stresses on the bottom surface of compsites should be positive under bending!?!?!?!

	Benchmarking:
		- DSG transverse shear recovery:
		- DSG composite stress recovery for transverse shear!

	
	Report:
		- (Up next)
		- Update snapthru graphs for displacement control
		- Revise composites section
		- Implementation of composites
		- Tsai Wu and implementation
		- 
		- (Soon)
		- Hinged cylinder - update results graph
		- Open cyl - update results graph
		- 3 param background - figure out why Gotta figure out lamda - G = lamda
		- 
		- (Whenever)
		- Cleanup equation spacing
		- alignment of pseudocode on page - try out figure around algortithm
		- Check Bibliography special characters
		- Check breaking of \texttt formatted words
		- See if kratos thick tri material mat includes off-diag poisson and update report!
