Problems:
	- Composite only works when set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
	- quad gauss point results are crap for the existing element too!

To Do:	
	- Original DSG derivation
		- write up in report, esp the DOF ordering and rotation definitions
	- Set alignment of shells in MDPA
		- Add in alignment visualisation
		- Add in element conditions in the MDPA prescribing alignment
	- Element tests
		- Composite tests
	

	
Report:
	- Continue review
	- Kg derivation for shells ????
	
	- (Up next)
	- Transverse shear stress results discussion!
	- Stresses on the bottom surface of compsites should be positive under bending!?!?!?!
	- 
	- (Soon)
	- 3 param background - figure out why Gotta figure out lamda - G = lamda
	- 
	- (Whenever)
	- Cleanup equation spacing
	- alignment of pseudocode on page - try out figure around algortithm
	- Check Bibliography special characters
	- Check breaking of \texttt formatted words
	- See if kratos thick tri material mat includes off-diag poisson and update report!
