To Do:
	
	Coding:
		- Composite progression:
			- Make material law derived from constitutive law, so it can be easily uncoupled from solid_mechanics
			- Open thread about how to best represent composite layers on Github
			- Stress recovery for composites
			- Dynamics for composites
			- Open thread about run_tests error
				
				

		- thin quad quantity recovery:
			- main improvement from beta1 = 0. Wait for Haugen response
			- shell quantity recovery benchmarks
	
	Report:
		- Write composites section
		- Update snapthru graphs for displacement control
		- Write stress results benchmark results section after thin quad is all done
		- 
		- 
		- Hinged cylinder - update results graph
		- Open cyl - update results graph
		- 
		- 
		- Cleanup equation spacing
		- alignment of pseudocode on page
		- Check Bibliography special characters
		- Check breaking of \texttt formatted words
		- See if kratos thick tri material mat includes off-diag poisson and update report!
		- 3 param background - figure out why Gotta figure out lamda - G = lamda
