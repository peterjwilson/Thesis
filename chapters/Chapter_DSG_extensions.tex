\lettrine[lines=2]{W}{ith} the elements formulation, background and validation complete, some examples of their application are now considered. An emphasis is placed on the relative strengths and weaknesses of eac

\section{DSG triangle ordering dependency}
asdfasdf

\section{Cell Smoothed DSG approach}
Summary of approach
Results of shell obstacle course vs original DSG

\section{DSGc3 approach}
Summary of approach
Current state of development

\section{Appraisal of alternative DSG technology approaches}
CST vs DSG vs CS-DSG
study of when nodal ordering disappears (start with 2 element square, then refine until elements converge)
bar graph: Computation speed vs element for large mesh (10, 000 elements)
scatter graph: computation speed vs accuracy vs mesh refinement
establish pareto front
