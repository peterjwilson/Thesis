\chapter{DSG triangle shell element}
\label{chap:chapter_3}

\renewcommand{\Thema}{DSG triangle shell element}

The follow sequence elucidates the formulation and implementation of the stiffness matrix, mass matrix and quantity recovery associated with the DSG triangle shell element in Kratos. 

\section{Stiffness matrix formulation}

Based on the 5 parameter Reissner-Mindlin shell theory, the thick shell considers internal energy contributions from membrane, bending and shear components. As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:chapter_2}, basic finite elements derived from this shell theory face locking problems as the shell slenderness ratio increases. The element implemented is Bletzinger's Discrete Shear Gap (DSG) shell \cite{Ble00} which incorporates an enhanced shear strain formulation to mitigate the aforementioned locking. This triangular element has 18 DOFs ordered as such:
\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{u}^T = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{u_1} & \mathbf{u_2} & \mathbf{u_3}
\end{pmatrix} 
\hspace{10mm}
where
\hspace{10mm}
\mathbf{u}_i^T = 
\begin{pmatrix}
{u_{xi}} & {u_{yi}} & {u_{yi}} & {\beta_{xi}} & {\beta_{yi}} & {\beta_{zi}}
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt1}
\end{equation}
The element displacement field is related to the discrete nodal values via shape functions.
\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{u}(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^3 \ N_i(x,y) \mathbf{u}_i
\label{eqt2}
\end{equation}
$N_i$ are the standard linear triangle shape functions, referred to the Cartesian system, considering the corner points of the triangle $x_i,\ y_i$.
\begin{gather} 
	\begin{aligned}
		&N_1 (x , y) = \frac{1}{2 A} \big[ (x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2) + x(y_2 - y_3) + y(x_3 - x_2) \big]
		\\
		&N_2 (x , y) = \frac{1}{2 A} \big[ (x_3 y_1 - x_1 y_3) + x(y_3 - y_1) + y(x_1 - x_3) \big]
		\\
		&N_3 (x , y) = \frac{1}{2 A} \big[ (x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1) + x(y_1 - y_2) + y(x_2 - x_1) \big]
		\label{eqt3}
	\end{aligned}
\end{gather}

Analogous to internal energy, the element stiffness matrix of the DSG triangle can be decomposed into membrane, bending and shear contributions.

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{K}_{mem} + \mathbf{K}_{bend} + \mathbf{K}_{shear}
\label{eqt4}
\end{equation}

The above expression can be expanded into strain-displacement and material matrices relevant for each component.

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{K} = \int_A  (\mathbf{B}_{mem}^T \mathbf{C}_{mem} \mathbf{B}_{mem} + \mathbf{B}_{bend}^T \mathbf{C}_{bend} \mathbf{B}_{bend} + \mathbf{B}_{shear}^T \mathbf{C}_{shear} \mathbf{B}_{shear})\ dA
\label{eqt5}
\end{equation}

Rama et al. \cite{Ram16} present the DSG formulation in a similar manner, detailing the strain displacement matrix and material material of each constituent separately.

The membrane strain displacement matrix requires no enhancement since linear triangle elements are impervious to membrane locking as discussed in section \ref{membrane_locking_theory}. Thus, the standard displacement-based formulation can be confidently utilised:

\section{ADD IN THEORY OF MEMBRANE DERIVATION HERE !!!!!}

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{B}_{mem} =  \begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{B}_{mem_1} & \mathbf{B}_{mem_2} & \mathbf{B}_{mem_3}
\end{pmatrix} 
\label{eqt6}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{B}_{mem_i} =  \begin{pmatrix}
N_{i,x} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & N_{i,y} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
N_{i,y} & N_{i,x} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} 
\label{eqt7}
\end{equation}

The bending strain displacement matrix is also a simple standard displacement-based formulation and can be presented in a similar manner:

\section{ADD IN THEORY OF MEMBRANE DERIVATION HERE !!!!!}

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{B}_{bend} =  \begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{B}_{bend_1} & \mathbf{B}_{bend_2} & \mathbf{B}_{bend_3}
\end{pmatrix} 
\label{eqt8}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{B}_{bend_i} =  \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & N_{i,x} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -N_{i,y} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -N_{i,x} & N_{i,y} & 0
\end{pmatrix} 
\label{eqt9}
\end{equation}

Finally, the shear strain displacement matrix, which implements the DSG element enhancement technology fully derived in Appendix \ref{app:DSG technology derivation} and mitigates shear locking, is expressed as follows:

\begin{gather} 
	\begin{aligned}
		& \mathbf{B}_{shear} =  \frac{1}{2 A}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			0 & 0 & b-c & 0 & A & 0 & 0 & 0 & c & \frac{-bc}{2} & \frac{ac}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & -b & \frac{bc}{2} & \frac{bd}{2} & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & d-a & -A & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -d & \frac{bd}{2} & \frac{-ad}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & a & \frac{-ac}{2} & \frac{ad}{2} & 0
		\end{pmatrix}
		\\
		& with:\ 
		a = x_2-x_1,\ 
		b = y_2-y_1,\ 
		c = y_3-y_1,\ 
		d = x_3 - x_1
		\label{eqt10}
	\end{aligned}
\end{gather}

The material matrices for the membrane and bending parts are presented below:

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{C}_{mem} =  \frac{Eh}{(1-\nu^2)}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \nu & 0 \\
\nu & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{(1-\nu)}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt11}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{C}_{bend} =  \frac{E h^3}{12(1-\nu^2)}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \nu & 0 \\
\nu & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{(1-\nu)}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt12}
\end{equation}

To further improve the DSG element performance, Bischoff and Bletzinger \cite{Bis04} \cite{Bis01} applied the enhancement approach that Lyly suggested for MITC-4 elements \cite{Lyl93}. This approach modifies the internal shear energy term by scaling the shear constitutive matrix with a correction term $\tau$ incorporating the element thickness and an indicator of element size ($h_k$ = longest element side length). The enhanced  shear constitutive matrix is thus:

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{C}_{shear} =  \tau \kappa Gh
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \nu \\
\nu & 1 
\end{pmatrix}
=
\frac{\kappa G h^3}{h^2 + \alpha h_k^2}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \nu \\
\nu & 1 
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt14}
\end{equation}

where $\kappa = \frac{5}{6}$ is the shear correction factor and $\alpha = 0.1$ as per \cite{Lyl93}.

As described in section \ref{transverse_shear_locking}, transverse shear locking is driven by a mismatch of internal energy allocation between bending ($\Pi_{bend} \propto h^3$) and shear components ($\Pi_{shear} \propto h$) as $h \rightarrow 0$.  This modification somewhat alleviates the locking by 'encouraging' the internal shear energy to scale with the cube of the thickness too, thus reducing the artificial energy disparity.

Although all stiffness components are assembled, one notices that lack of entries corresponding to the drilling DOF $\beta_{zi}$ currently renders the element stiffness matrix singular. The technology of drilling DOFs discussed in \ref{drilling_DOF_section} in thus introduced. Nguyen-Thoi et al. \cite{Ngu13} proposed to remedy this rotational singularity by setting the drilling DOF entries to one one-thousandth of the maximum diagonal entry in the element stiffness matrix.

\begin{equation} 
K_{\beta_{zi}} =  \frac{max(K_{ij}\delta_{ij})}{1000}
\label{eqtdrilling}
\end{equation}

\section{Stiffness matrix implementation}
Despite the relatively simple decoupled stiffness formulation presented, the practical programming of it invariably introduces it's own complexities. Furthermore, leveraging the existing functionality that the Kratos code possesses not only prevents re-inventing the wheel, but also makes the code more readable and functionally cohesive.  

The new DSG triangle element is implemented in the files $\texttt{shell\_thick\_element\_3D3N.hpp}$ and $\texttt{shell\_thick\_element\_3D3N.cpp}$, which are compiled into the  'StructuralMechanicsApplication' module of Kratos. Without extending into extraneous details, the DSG triangle element is derived from the Kratos $\texttt{element}$ class and makes extensive use of other existing Kratos utility classes including those offering: coordinate transformations, material properties and pre-defined stiffness matrix and residual vector data types. Correspondingly, it is also subject to the constraints associated with each of these. From a high level view, however, the element stiffness matrix follows the subsequent workflow:

\begin{figure}[H]
	% Define block styles
	\tikzstyle{virtual} = [rectangle, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=orange!30]
	\tikzstyle{process} = [rectangle, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=white!30]
	\tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick,->,>=stealth]
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 1.9cm, auto]
	% Place nodes
	\node [process] (CalculateLocalSystem) {$\texttt{CalculateLocalSystem()}$};
	\node [process, right of=CalculateLocalSystem, xshift = 4cm] (CalculateAll) {$\texttt{CalculateAll()}$};
	\node [process, below of=CalculateAll, xshift = -0cm] (InitializeCalculationData) {$\texttt{InitializeCalculationData()}$};
	\node [process, below of=InitializeCalculationData, yshift = -0cm] (CalculateSectionResponse) {$\texttt{CalculateSectionResponse()}$};
	\node [process, below of=CalculateSectionResponse, yshift = -0cm] (FinalizeCalculations) {$\texttt{FinalizeCalculations()}$};
	% Draw edges
	\draw [arrow] (CalculateLocalSystem) -- (CalculateAll);
	\draw [arrow] (CalculateAll) -- (InitializeCalculationData);
	\draw [arrow] (InitializeCalculationData) -- (CalculateSectionResponse);
	\draw [arrow] (CalculateSectionResponse) -- (FinalizeCalculations);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{High level overview of DSG element workflow}
	\label{DSGworkflow}
\end{figure}

Initially, the re-implemented virtual method $\texttt{CalculateLocalSystem()}$ is called by the Kratos framework automatically for every $\texttt{ShellThickElement3D3N}$ in the job definition. This method redirects to $\texttt{CalculateAll()}$, which is the main pipeline of the element stiffness calculation, itself calling three key methods: $\texttt{InitializeCalculationData()},$ \break$\texttt{CalculateSectionResponse()}$ and $\texttt{FinalizeCalculations()}$.

Following the general form of the existing shell elements in Kratos, all the data which remains constant through the Gauss Integration loop is calculated beforehand in the function $\texttt{InitializeCalculationData()}$. The DSG element follows this tradition for consistency, although it isn't strictly necessary because it only requires one Gauss point for the numerical integration. Following $\texttt{InitializeCalculationData()}$, $\texttt{CalculateSectionResponse()}$ is called and the material matrix is populated with existing Kratos material classes. It must be noted here that a single 8$\times$8 material matrix $\mathbf{C}$ is returned which is structured as follows (for the setting of 'thick' shell kinematics):

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{C}_{Kratos} =  
\begin{pmatrix}
	\mathbf{C}_{mem} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} \\
	\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{C}_{bend} & \mathbf{0} \\
	\mathbf{0} & 	\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{C}_{shear}
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqtCkratos}
\end{equation} 

At this stage the shear component of the material matrix is currently unmodified, thus it is subsequently corrected with $\tau$ as per equation \eqref{eqt14}. The DOF arrangement of the material matrix also motivates a slight departure from the strain displacement matrices as presented above. Although the element stiffness matrix can certainly be programmed in it's constitutive parts, as per equation \eqref{eqt5}, it is more concise to calculate it as follows:

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{K} = \int_A  (\mathbf{B}_{comb}^T \mathbf{C}_{Kratos} \mathbf{B}_{comb} )\ dA
= A\  \mathbf{B}_{comb}^T \mathbf{C}_{Kratos} \mathbf{B}_{comb} 
\label{eqtKkratos}
\end{equation}

A consequence of this arrangement is that the combined strain displacement matrix created in $\texttt{InitializeCalculationData()}$ must conform to the DOF ordering of the material matrix layout.

The element stiffness matrix is calculated according to equation \eqref{eqtKkratos} and subsequently modified to include an artificial drilling DOF stiffness as per equation \eqref{eqtdrilling}. Lastly, this is followed by a call to the Kratos function $\texttt{FinalizeCalculations()}$ which handles the transformation from the element to the global orientation.

The following pseudocode summarises the key calls and operations involved in calculating the DSG element stiffness matrix.

\section{Mass matrix formulation and implementation}

The specification of a mass matrix is necessary to facilitate dynamic analysis with the thick triangular shell element. Both lumped and consistent mass matrices are offered, with the lumped mass matrix used by default.

\subsection{Lumped mass matrix}
The default mass matrix employed is a lumped approach, which results in a diagonal mass matrix that ignores rotary inertia.

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{M} =  
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{M}_1 & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{M}_2 & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{M}_3
\end{pmatrix}
\hspace{10mm}
where
\hspace{10mm}
\mathbf{M}_i =  
\begin{pmatrix}
\bar{m} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \bar{m} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & \bar{m} &0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt15}
\end{equation}

The general lumped mass is determined for a multi-ply material with $n$ plies each of $h_i$ thickness and $\rho_i$ density as follows:

\begin{equation} 
\bar{m} = \frac{A}{3} \sum_{i=1}^n \rho_i h_i
\label{eqt16}
\end{equation}

For a single layer material of area $A$ this reduces to:

\begin{equation} 
\bar{m} = \frac{A}{3} \rho h
\label{eqt17}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Consistent mass matrix}
If the virtual work expression of a general shell element is expanded to include dynamics, the virtual kinetic energy $\delta K$, virtual internal strain energy $\delta U$ and virtual external potential $\delta V$ are related over a time interval $T$ as such:

\begin{equation} 
\int_{0}^{T} \delta K - (\delta U - \delta V) \ dt = 0
\label{eqt17_1}
\end{equation}

Focussing solely on the kinetic energy, pertinent to the consistent mass matrix, clarifying motion in three dimensions yields:

\begin{equation} 
\delta K = \int_{V} \rho 
(
\dot{u_1} \delta \dot{u_1} + 
\dot{u_2} \delta \dot{u_2} + 
\dot{u_3} \delta \dot{u_3}
)
\ dV
\label{eqt17_2}
\end{equation}

The volume integral can be split into area and thickness integrals and referred to mid-plane velocity components $(\dot{u_0},\ \dot{v_0},\ \dot{w_0})$:
\begin{gather} 
	\begin{aligned}
		\delta K = \int_{\Omega} \int_{\frac{-h}{2}}^{\frac{h}{2}} \rho 
		\Big[
		(\dot{u_0} + z\dot{\beta_1})  (\delta \dot{u_0} + z\delta\dot{\beta_1})+ 
		&(\dot{v_0} + z\dot{\beta_2})  (\delta \dot{v_0} + z\delta\dot{\beta_2})+
		\\
		&(\dot{w_0} + z\dot{\beta_3})  (\delta \dot{w_0} + z\delta\dot{\beta_3})
		\Big]
		\ dz
		\ d\Omega
		\label{eqt17_3}
	\end{aligned}
\end{gather}

The through-thickness integration can be simplified with the help of defining the following translational and rotational inertias under the assumption of constant density throughout the shell thickness:
\begin{gather} 
	\begin{aligned}
		&\ \ \ \ \ 
		I_i = \int_{\frac{-h}{2}}^{\frac{h}{2}} \rho 
		z^i
		\ dz
		\hspace{10mm}
		(i = 0,\ 1,\ 2)
		\\
		&I_0 = \rho h\ ,
		\hspace{10mm}
		I_1 = 0\ ,
		\hspace{10mm}
		I_2 = \frac{\rho h^3}{12}
		\label{eqt17_4}
	\end{aligned}
\end{gather}

Substituting the inertias into equation \ref{eqt17_3} yields:

\begin{equation} 
	\delta K = \int_{\Omega} 
	\Big[I_0
	(\dot{u_0} \delta \dot{u_0} 
	+ \dot{v_0} \delta \dot{v_0}
	+ \dot{w_0} \delta \dot{w_0}
	)  
	+
	I_2
	(\dot{\beta_1} \delta \dot{\beta_1} 
	+ \dot{\beta_2} \delta \dot{\beta_2} 
	)  
	\Big]
	\ d\Omega
	\label{eqt17_5}
\end{equation}

Analogous to the method of discretized displacement field, the cartesian velocity and acceleration field can be expressed in terms of shape functions and discrete nodal quantities for both translational and rotational dofs, ordered as per equation \ref{eqt1}:

\begin{equation} 
\dot{\mathbf{u}} (x,y)
=
\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i (x,y)
\hat{\dot{\mathbf{u}}}_i\ ,
\hspace{10mm}
\ddot{\mathbf{u}} (x,y)
=
\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i (x,y)
\hat{\ddot{\mathbf{u}}}_i\ ,
\label{eqt17_6}
\end{equation}

Approached from this discretized perspective, equation \ref{eqt17_5} can be developed into:

\begin{equation} 
\delta K = \mathbf{M}_C \hat{\ddot{\mathbf{{u}}}} \delta \hat{\mathbf{u}}
=
\int_{\Omega} 
\Big[I_0
\mathbf{N}_T^T
\mathbf{N}_T
+
I_2
\mathbf{N}_R^T
\mathbf{N}_R
\Big]
\ d\Omega\ 
\hat{\ddot{\mathbf{{u}}}}
\delta \hat{\mathbf{u}}
\label{eqt17_7}
\end{equation}

The matrices $\mathbf{N}_T$ and $\mathbf{N}_R$ arrange nodal shape functions $N_i$ to filter the appropriate translational and rotational DOFs respectively, defined as:

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{N}_T = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{N}_{T_1} & \mathbf{N}_{T_2} & \mathbf{N}_{T_3}
\end{pmatrix}\ ,
\hspace{10mm}
\mathbf{N}_R = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{N}_{R_1} & \mathbf{N}_{R_2} & \mathbf{N}_{R_3}
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt17_8}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{N}_{T_i} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
N_i & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & N_i & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & N_i & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\hspace{10mm}
\mathbf{N}_{R_i} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & N_i & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & N_i & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha N_i
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt17_9}
\end{equation}

It is noted that the drilling DOF has an artificial mass assigned to it, scaled by $\alpha$ from the other rotational DOFs.

By explicitly stating the translational and rotational inertias, the final expression for the consistent mass matrix $\mathbf{M}_C$ of a shell with constant thickness $h$ is derived:

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{M}_C
=
h
\int_{\Omega} 
\rho 
\Big[
\mathbf{N}_T^T
\mathbf{N}_T
+
\frac{h^2}{12}
\mathbf{N}_R^T
\mathbf{N}_R
\Big]
\ d\Omega
\label{eqt17_10}
\end{equation}

If the average shell density $\bar{\rho}$ is taken at the element centroid, the resulting consistent mass matrix of the DSG element can be explicitly evaluated as:

\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{M}_C
=
\frac{\bar{\rho} h A}{12}

\section{Stress and strain recovery}

While the stiffness and mass matrices enable the calculation of nodal displacements, velocities and accelerations, practical engineering analysis is usually more concerned with the strains and stresses of the structure. The non-zero local strains ($\epsilon_{zz} = 0$) of the 5 parameter element can be arranged in a vector form:

\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^T = \begin{pmatrix}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_1 & \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_2 & \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_3
\end{pmatrix}
\hspace{5mm}
with
\hspace{5mm}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^T_i = \begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_{xx} & \epsilon_{xx} & 2\epsilon_{xy} & \kappa_{xx} & \kappa_{yy} & 2\kappa_{xy} & 2\epsilon_{xz} & 2\epsilon_{yz}
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt18}
\end{equation}

The strain field within the element can be recovered from the displacement field by using the strain displacement matrix, which is constant over the element for the DSG triangle.

\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}(\xi,\ \eta) = \mathbf{B}\ \mathbf{u}(\xi,\ \eta)
\label{eqt19}
\end{equation}

In typical finite element programs the strains and stresses are calculated at the Gauss points of the element, which is also how Kratos operates. Since the DSG has one Gauss point in the centre of the element, the strain is recovered from the discrete nodal displacements $\hat{\mathbf{u}}_i$ as follows:

\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{GP} = \mathbf{B} \sum_{i=1}^{3\ nodes} N_i(\xi_{GP},\ \eta_{GP}) \hat{\mathbf{u}}_i
\label{eqt20}
\end{equation}

With the strains determined, the stresses at the Gauss points can be recovered with the material matrix at the Gauss point.

\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{GP} = \mathbf{C}_{GP}\ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{GP}
\label{eqt21}
\end{equation}

The general implementation of the stress and strain recovery described above is illustrated in the following pseudocode.

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{DSG triangle element stress and strain recovery}

\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Von Mises equivalent stress}

The Von Mises equivalent stress is a convenient method to translate a complex 3 dimensional stress state into an equivalent scalar value. As such, it's computation requires element stresses to be recovered, the tensor of which is:

\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{xz} \\
\sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{yy} & \sigma_{yz} \\
\sigma_{xz} & \sigma_{yy} & \sigma_{zz}
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqt22}
\end{equation}

Limiting the tensor to plane stress states, the deviatoric stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}'$ can be derived by subtracting the mean hydrostatic stress $\sigma_{H}$:
\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol{\sigma}' = \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \sigma_{H} \delta_{ij} = 
\frac{1}{3}
\begin{pmatrix}
2\sigma_{xx}-\sigma_{yy} & 3\sigma_{xy} & 3\sigma_{xz} \\
3\sigma_{xy} & 2\sigma_{yy}-\sigma_{xx} & 3\sigma_{yz} \\
3\sigma_{xz} & 3\sigma_{yy} & -\sigma_{xx}-\sigma_{yy} \\
\end{pmatrix}\ ,
\hspace{5mm}
\sigma_{H} = \frac{\sigma_{xx} + \sigma_{yy} + (\sigma_{zz} = 0)}{3}
\label{eqt23}
\end{equation}

The Von Mises equivalent stress is a scaling of the second deviatoric stress invariant $J_2$ related by:

\begin{equation} 
\sigma_{VM} = \sqrt{3J_2} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}\boldsymbol{\sigma}' : \boldsymbol{\sigma}'}
\label{eqt24}
\end{equation}

Expanding the above expression in conjuction with equation \ref{eqt23}, the Von Mises equivalent stress for the 5 parameter shell model is simplified to:

\begin{equation} 
\sigma_{VM} = 
\sqrt{
\sigma_{xx}^2
- \sigma_{xx}\sigma_{yy}
+ \sigma_{yy}^2
+ 3(\sigma_{xy}^2 + \sigma_{xz}^2 + \sigma_{yz}^2)
}
\label{eqt25}
\end{equation}
