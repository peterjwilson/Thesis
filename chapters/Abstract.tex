\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{cha:abstract}

In this work, a thin quadrilateral shell element implemented in the multiphysics code KRATOS is presented. The element considered is composed of an Assumed Natural Deviatoric Strains (ANDES) membrane formulation and a Discrete Kirchhoff Quadrilateral (DKQ) bending formulation. Both of these formulations are examined, as well as the general implementation of them in the KRATOS code. Finally, the shell element is tested with the well known shell obstacle course and future work pertaining to the element is identified.\\
